# TurtleCoin Tips

A TurtleCoin tips service.

## Setup

### Create the app config

In firestore create a document at the location: `globals/config`

Set a property named `tipTimeoutDays` (number) to the amount of days an unclaimed tip has before the sender will be refunded. A number lower than 1 means there will be no timeout for unclaimed tips.

### Configure firebase environment variables

```sh
# Set the following Github probot variables:
firebase functions:config:set probot.app_id="YOUR GITHUB APP ID"
firebase functions:config:set probot.webhook_secret="YOUR WEBHOOK SECRET"
firebase functions:config:set probot.private_key="YOUR PRIVATE KEY"

# Set the following TRTL Apps variables:
firebase functions:config:set trtl.app_id="YOUR TRTL APP ID"
firebase functions:config:set trtl.app_secret="YOUR TRTL APP SECRET"
```

## Project structure

The frontend React app can be found in the `/frontend` folder.

The backend code is located in the `/functions` folder.

## CI/CD

See the `frontend/README.md` for details on how to build, test and deploy the frontend app.

### Updating firestore indexes
